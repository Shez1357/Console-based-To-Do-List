# Console based To Do List

 This is a basic console based To Do list program made in c++ and it allows you to do:

 **✅ Add tasks**
 
**✅ Remove tasks from a map**

 **✅ View all your tasks**

 # Features 

**🎨 Color-coded messages for better visibility**: So when you get an error or input something sucessfully it will alert you in a different colour of text to make you aware if it was sucessful or not.

**🔄 ESC key support to go back to the menu**:This allow the user to use the esc key to go back from any screen to the menu screen instead of saying press "q" to go back.

**📜 Dynamic Screen Clearing**: The console is cleared before displaying new content to keep the interface clean and readable.

 # What i learned

**🗺️ Using Maps**: I learned how to use a map to store and manage data efficiently.

**⌨️ Mastering ASCII Keys**: I gained a deeper understanding of ASCII key inputs and how they can improve user experience.

**🔄 Seamless Navigation**: Implementing the ESC key for navigation makes the program feel more natural and intuitive.

**🎯 Understanding _getch() & _kbhit()**: These functions are powerful for handling keyboard input, and I learned how to use them effectively for a smoother user experience.
